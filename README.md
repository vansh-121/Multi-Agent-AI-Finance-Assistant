## Overview

The **Multi-Agent AI Finance Assistant** is an open-source platform designed to provide intelligent financial analysis and decision-making support using a multi-agent AI framework. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and advanced financial algorithms, this project enables users to perform tasks such as equity research, market forecasting, portfolio optimization, and document analysis. The system employs a modular, agent-based architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to deliver precise and actionable financial insights.

This project is ideal for financial analysts, developers, and researchers looking to harness AI for financial applications. It demonstrates the power of multi-agent systems in tackling complex, real-world financial challenges.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents (e.g., Market Forecasting Agent, Document Analysis Agent) work together to process financial data and provide comprehensive insights.
- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Integrates state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA) for natural language understanding and financial reasoning.
- **Financial Data Integration**: Supports real-time and historical market data via APIs (e.g., Financial Datasets API, Yahoo Finance).
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Enhances decision-making by breaking down complex financial problems into logical steps.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generates equity research reports in PDF format based on company financials (e.g., 10-K reports).
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows easy addition of new agents or data sources.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Command-line interface for seamless interaction and task execution.
